# Lesson 1
In this lesson we basically just looked at some exercises from a logical point of view.
Here are three examples of how we would implement the exercises in C. 

The functionality is calculating the mean between two numbers and the area of a triangle based on its height and base length.

## Example 1
This is the simplest solution, without any kind of error handling or boundary checks.

## Example 2
In this example we're not being careful about boundary checks or errors but the code is a bit cleaner as we separated it into modules.

## Example 3
This includes basic functions allowing a better error handling, as well as boundary checking and memory allocation. More improvements are possible but this should be good for now.
